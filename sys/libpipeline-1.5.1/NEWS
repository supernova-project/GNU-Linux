libpipeline 1.5.1 (27 January 2019)
===================================

Building libpipeline now requires Autoconf >= 2.63 and Automake >= 1.11.2.

Various portability improvements, via Gnulib.

libpipeline 1.5.0 (14 November 2017)
====================================

Add `pipecmd_pre_exec' to install a pre-exec handler for a single command.

libpipeline 1.4.2 (10 July 2017)
================================

Fix EOF detection in get_line.

libpipeline 1.4.1 (17 August 2015)
==================================

Fix test failure with Check 0.10.0.

libpipeline 1.4.0 (25 October 2014)
===================================

Various portability fixes for Solaris, mostly suggested by Peter Bray.  This
includes a PIPELINE_QUIET environment variable which suppresses the error
message normally emitted when a subprocess is terminated by a signal.

Add `pipecmd_fchdir', which is analogous to `pipecmd_chdir' but takes an
open file descriptor rather than a path.

libpipeline 1.3.1 (22 September 2014)
=====================================

Fix test failures on Cygwin.

Fix build on systems with neither setenv nor clearenv, e.g. Solaris 8.

libpipeline 1.3.0 (26 March 2014)
=================================

Add `pipecmd_chdir' to run a command with a different working directory.

libpipeline 1.2.6 (18 December 2013)
====================================

Fix test_pump_tee to wait for its child processes before testing their
output, since otherwise not all their output might be flushed.

libpipeline 1.2.5 (3 December 2013)
===================================

pipeline_want_infile and pipeline_want_outfile now take copies of their file
name arguments.

Restore compatibility with Automake 1.10.

Build with large file support on systems where it is available.

libpipeline 1.2.4 (6 June 2013)
===============================

Provide a replacement clearenv function in order to support non-glibc
systems.  Now tested on FreeBSD.

libpipeline 1.2.3 (24 April 2013)
=================================

Don't read uninitialised memory when testing for the end of long lines (over
4096 bytes).

Flush stdio before starting a sequence.

libpipeline 1.2.2 (17 September 2012)
=====================================

Make pipeline_start flush stdio after emitting debugging output.

Build fixes for glibc 2.16 and Automake 1.12.

libpipeline 1.2.1 (2 March 2012)
================================

Retry reads and writes on EINTR.

Fix opening of output files requested by `pipeline_want_outfile'; these are
now created if they do not already exist, and truncated if they do.

<pipeline.h> is now wrapped in `extern "C"' when used in a C++ compilation
unit.

libpipeline 1.2.0 (18 March 2011)
=================================

Add `pipeline_get_pid' to get the process ID of a command in a started
pipeline.

libpipeline 1.1.0 (11 December 2010)
====================================

Add `pipecmd_exec' to execute a single command, replacing the current
process; this is analogous to `execvp'.

Add `pipecmd_clearenv' to clear a command's environment; this is analogous
to `clearenv'.

Add `pipecmd_get_nargs' to get the number of arguments to a command.

libpipeline 1.0.0 (29 October 2010)
===================================

This is a new C library for pipeline manipulation, broken out from man-db
2.5.8.
